application chalane ke lie jo dependecies chaiye hoti hai
docker in sab ko pack krke container mai chalayega
app+os+software package krta hai
docker is advance version of virtualisation
virtualisation advance version of containerisatin
container ka khud ka os nahi hota hai[100% os mai hai to 5% hi lega jo missing hai]
 container ke andar 5% os hota hai os line untuu
docker khud ko chalene ke lie linux ka use krta hai
no preallocation of RAM
container is the running state of image
docker deamon will make image of container
docker user can interact with docker daemon through client(cli)
docker images are read only binary templates
ways to create images
1-take image from docker hub
2-create image from docker file
3-create image from existing docker container

Install Docker:

Pre Requisites:
WSL2
sudo apt install docker
sudo service docker start
sudo docker run hello-world



commands
1-docker images to check images present
2-docker search jenkins
3-docker pull <image name>
4-docker run -it --name /bin/bash
 run(image create+start) (i interactive mode t terminal) name=name of container
5-service docker status (to check if docker is running)
6-docker start container_name
7-docker attach <container_name>
8-to see all container docker ps -a (ps =process status)
9-docker ps (only running containers)
10-docker stop <container name>
11-docker rm <container name> delete a container
12-to check if docker is installed or not (which docker)
13-docker --version
14-service docker start (to start the service)
15-service docker stop (to stop the service)
16-sudo docker images
17-sudo docker ps
18-docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
19-exit from container (exit)
20-sudo docker ps (this time it will create a new container id)
21-to pull and image
22-docker pull jenkins
23-docker run -it jenkins /bin/bash
24-to create a container of custom names docker run --name bhawesh -it jenkins /bin/bash
25-to start a stopped container docker start <container name>
26-to go inside the started container :docker attach <container_name>
27-to stop a running container docker stop <container name>
28-to delete a container docker rm <container name>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
steps to create docker image from file
1-create a container from ubuntu image and name it bhawesh_ubuntu
sudo docker run --name bhawesh_ubuntu -it ubuntu /bin/bash
2-create a folder and a file
3-exit the container
3-to check the difference from the base image you made in the container run
 sudo docker diff bhawesh_ubuntu
4-to create an image from the docker container
docker commit <containername> <faviorite image name>
sudo docker commit bhawesh_ubuntu updated_bhawesh_ubuntu
5-docker images
6-sudo docker run -it updated_bhawesh_ubuntu /bin/bash
(this will create a container from the image now)
7-docker ps -a (to check the container built)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
docker file ----->image------->container

Dockerfile is a text file .it contains set of instructions
It automates image creation process


Docker Components

FROM -for base image.This command must be on top of Dockerfile

RUN - to execute command ,it will create a layer in image

MAINTAINER -Author/Owner
COPY- Copy files from local system(docker vm).We need to provide source,destination (We cant download file from internet and any remote app)

ADD-similar to COPY but,it provides a feature to download files from internet ,also we extract files from internet

EXPOSE - to expose  ports such as port 8080 for tomcat ,port 80 for nginx

WORKDIR - to set working dir for a container
CMD - Execute commands but during container creation

ENTRYPOINT-similar to CMD but has higher prioirity over CMD ,first command will be executed with entry point only
ENV-Environment Variables

Steps to create image from docker file
1-create a file named Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN echo "Bhawesh">/tmp/test

2-To create image out of dockerfile
docker build -t myimage . (dot means docker file is in the current directory)
t=tag myimage(name of image)
image is built
docker ps -a
docker images
