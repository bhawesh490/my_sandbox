1-decoraters are form on meta programming
2-they allow us to wrap functionality around an already defined function 
3-without having to modify the code of original function 
4-leverages clousures 

why are decorators useful?
-suppose we have a program with some functions called over and over again 
-fun1 ,fun2,fun3 etc 
-every time one of those functions is called we want to produce a log
-may be just print to the console that the function was called 
-we could certainly put the logging functionality into each function 
-def fun1():
    print("called fun1:)
-def fun2():
    print("called func2:)
-so we are repeating the same code multiple times 
-what if we want to include date/time call was made 
-go back to the code and edit the logging code inside each funciton 
-3 weeks later somebody tells me that we need to add timings as well 
-go back and edit the logging code inside each function 

-to avoid this we use decorators 
example what we want is that :
fun1(10,20)->start timing 
           ->result = fun1(10, 20)
           ->stop timing
           ->log call,date/time and timing
           ->return result 

fun2(10,20)->start timing 
           ->result = fun2(10, 20)
           ->stop timing
           ->log call,date/time and timing
           ->return result 

-we can achieve this wrapper functinality using closures 
def outer(fn):
    def inner():
        print(f'calling {fn}')
        result = fn()   fn is a free variable from outer scope
        return result 
    return inner 

def hello():
    return 'Hello'
f = outer(hello)  ->inner function is created 
                  ->it is a closure with fn poiting to hello 
f()->call inner ,with fn pointing to hello 
   ->this calls hello()
   ->and returns the result of that call 

so we can say that decorators are kind of wrappers 
def fun(a, b):
    some code 
fun = wrapper(fun)  ----->shorthand notation---->      @wrapper 
                                                        def fun(a ,b):
                                                           some code 

other dunder method                                         
fun.__name__
it gives the name of the function 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------
lru caching 
1-this is a really interesting application of decorators
2-it solves the following problem 
3-you have some function that gets called ofter 
4-the same set of arguments are used often 
5-the function is deterministic 
 -calls with the same arguments should produce the same results 
6-re-calculating the function is fairly costly 
7-Here we would use a caching mechanism
8-first time a set of arguments is encountered ,calulates results 
9-store results in a cache dictionary 
10-subsequent calls with the same arguments recovers results from the cache 
11-python has such a decorator called lru cache decorator 
12-lru-least recently used 
13-caches should not grow indefinitely 
14-so keep the n most recent 

from functools import lru_cache
@lru_cache(maxsize=20)
def my_func(a, b):
   code here 

-uses a decorator
-this decorator can also take arguments 
-there is a restriction 
-the arguments passed to the function must be hashable values
