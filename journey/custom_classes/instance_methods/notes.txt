exactly same as the __init__ function
define a function in the class
first argument will be the instance

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        return f'Hello, {self.name}'
p = Person('Alex')
p.greet()
in above greet function since we have passed self we have access to the object so we can access now
object/instance name also


self == instance actually and this function greet is bounded to that particular instance

Remenber:
dunder method __init__ gets called automatically when an instance is created
but these custom methods which we create needs to be called
