my_obj = MyClass()
type(my_obj) --->MyClass
isinstance(my_obj, MyClass) -->True

when we call a class a class instance object is created
this class instance object has its own namespace(its own __dict__)
-distinct from the namespace of the class that was used to create the object
-this object has some attributes Python automatically implement for us

-->__dict__ :is the object local namespace
-->__class__:tells us which class was used to instantiate the object
-->prefer using type(obj) instead of obj.__class__
its important to understand that class and instances of the classes are not the same object
they have their own namespace
