#module1.py
class Python:
    kingdom = 'animals'
    phylum = 'chordata'
    family = 'pythonida'

    def __init__(self, species):
        self.species = species

    def say_hello(self):
        return 'sss_'

p = Python('monty')
module has its own(global) scope
contains Python and p

Now inside the class has its own scope
class body has itw own scope
contains kingdom,phylum,family,__init__,say_hello

what about the scope of functions defined in the body of the class
->turns out that they are NOT nested inside the class body scope
->symbols __init__,say hello are in the class body scope
-->but functions themselves are nested in the class's containing the scope(module1 in this example
)
