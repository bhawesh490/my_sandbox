Install Packages
pip-package installer for python 
installing 3rd party libraries(packages)  basically requires copying files into python installation(which ever directory we want)
can be done manually but tedius 
-->instead we can use another app called pip which get installed alongside with python 
-->this easily installs and removes and updates packages 
-->uses python package index (https://pypi.org)
-->official third party repo for python 
-->a repo over 200000 python packages 
use a requirements.txt file to keep track of libraries you have used 
pip freeze >>requirements.txt 
and when ever we have to install the packages again we can use 
pip install -r requirements.txt
