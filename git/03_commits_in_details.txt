when possible a commit should encompasses a single feature change or fix
in other words try to keep each commit focussed on a single thing
use present tense in commit messages
write code as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behaviour

git log --oneline

if we forget to add extra message in commit we can use

git commit --amend (to amend the previous commit)

scenairo:
you created two file
file 1
file 2
git add file 1
git commit -m "added file1"
<here you realised you have to add file 2 also in that commit"
git add file 2
git commit --ammend
